Wolph's Dotfiles
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Probably too specific for my needs for people to use out of the box, but there
might be some nice things in here which you will like.

Have a look around, take what you need and please drop me a line if you have
any questions or simply like the scripts/settings/etc.

Cheers :)

Installation
==============================================================================

If you are brave enough to give it a try, the install is fairly simple:

    git clone https://github.com/WoLpH/dotfiles.git
    cd dotfiles
    ./install.sh

Don't worry, it won't overwrite anything and only symlink the files to this
location if they don't exist yet. Trying is perfectly safe.
